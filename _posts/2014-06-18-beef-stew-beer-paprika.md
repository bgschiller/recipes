The beer in this stew instead of the usual red wine is an interesting change. I've used IPAs and Stouts with good results.

### Ingredients

- 3 Tablespoons Olive Oil
- 1 Tablespoon Butter
- 2 pounds Stew Meat
- 1 whole Medium Onion, Diced
- 3 cloves Garlic, Minced
- 1 can (12 Oz. Size) Beer
- 4 cups Beef Stock (or 4 Cups Water + 4 Beef Bouillon Cubes)
- 2 cups Water (additional, If Needed)
- 1 Tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
- 2 Tablespoons Tomato Paste
- 1/2 teaspoons Paprika
- 1/2 teaspoons Kosher Salt
- Freshly Ground Black Pepper
- 1.5 teaspoon Sugar
- 4 whole Carrots, Washed, Unpeeled, And Roughly Sliced
- 4 whole New Potatoes, Quartered
- Minced Parsley (optional)

Heat oil and butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Brown meat in two batches, setting aside on a plate when brown. Cut pieces in half. Set aside.

Add diced onions to the pot. Stir and cook for two or three minutes until softened, then add garlic for another minute. Pour in beer and beef stock, then add Worcestershire, tomato paste, paprika, salt, pepper, and sugar. Add beef back into the pot. Stir to combine. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Add carrots and potatoes, then cover and cook for an additional 30 minutes. (If stew gets dry, just add a cup of hot water at a time to replenish the liquid.) Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

Serve in bowls next to crusty French bread. Sprinkle with minced parsley, if desired.
