### Ingredients
  - any vegetables you like. I used:
    * Broccoli
    * a Bell Pepper
    * an Onion
    * Brussels Sprouts
    * Snow Peas
    * Carrots
    * Garlic
  - Coconut milk
  - Rice
  - Tofu (or Chicken)
  - Sweet Chili Sauce

Start the rice. You'll want to use half coconut milk and half water.

Cut the tofu into slabs, and put in a medium-hot skillet. Cook for ~5 mins per each side. Once the tofu is done, move it to a plate to make room for the veggies.

While the tofu is cooking, chop up the veggies in the order you want to fry them (Onions first, then garlic, ...).

Add them to a wok or skillet, using the countdown on the rice timer to decide when you want each vegetable to go in. Cut the tofu into squares and add it too. Finally, add some of the Sweet Chili Sauce.

Serve the veggies on the rice.
