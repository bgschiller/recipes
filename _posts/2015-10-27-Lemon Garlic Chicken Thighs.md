title: Lemon Garlic Chicken Thighs
---

### Ingredients
  - 6 Chicken Thighs
  - 1/3 cup Lemon Juice
  - 2 tsp Minced Garlic
  - 3/4 tsp Black Pepper
  - 1/2 tsp Salt

All measurements were made up. Use your best judgement.

Set the oven to broil at 500Â°. Mix together everything but the chicken thighs. Dunk the thighs (both sides -- get some garlic on there), and place in a ovenable dish, skin-side-up. Cook for 15 minutes all together, turning over every 5 minutes.
