###Directions

1. Bake sweet potatoes until tender, puree until smooth. (I've also had good results boiling the potatoes).
2. In a large bowl, sift together dry ingredients. Set aside.
3. Mix sweet potato with water, oil, and eggs.
4. Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Whisk together well until all of the flour is incorporated.
